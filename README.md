# Heursitic Search Visualizer with Map Generation

## Discretized Map
- SimpleGUIPyGame
	- 160 cols x 120 rows
- Blocked cells, Unblocked cells, Hard to Traverse cells, Unblocked Highway Cell, Hard to Traverse Highway Cell
	- Different costs for each direction

## Algorithms
- A*
- Weighted A*
- Sequential A*
- Uniform Cost Search

## Heuristics
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Eucidean Distance Squared
- Chebyshev Distance
- Octile Distance
- Mini Manhattan Distance (/4)

## Features
- Interative UI to explore many different search algorithms and heuristics to an automatically generated map. Map can be imported and exported for future use.
- Included also comes with a benchmarking tool for testing run time of each algorithm.
- Full report is attached in repository.
